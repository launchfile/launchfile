`generator: secret` now emits the spec-defined output — 32 bytes of cryptographically random data, hex-encoded as 64 lowercase characters (D-47).

**Both providers change observable output.** Neither emitted hex before: macos-dev produced 43 base64url characters, aws produced 32 alphanumeric characters. Both were already non-conforming to SPEC.md's shipped "cryptographically random hex string" wording.

**`@launchfile/aws` — existing stacks rotate their secret.** The generated resource changes from `random_password` to `random_bytes`. Those are different Terraform resource types, so a `moved` block cannot bridge them and the next `terraform apply` will destroy and recreate. Any value encrypted at rest under the old secret — a Laravel `APP_KEY`, outline's `SECRET_KEY` — becomes undecryptable. **Back up or re-key before upgrading.**

**`@launchfile/macos-dev` — the fix is not retroactive.** Generated secrets persist in `.launchfile/state.json` and are reused, so an existing deployment keeps its old value. This is deliberate (rotating a live secret on upgrade would be worse), but it means an app already deployed with a non-hex secret keeps it until that state is destroyed. This matters for `firefly-iii`, `monica` and `snipe-it`, whose `APP_KEY` is derived through `|base64` and requires exactly 32 bytes — they are broken on existing macos-dev deployments and stay broken until re-provisioned.
